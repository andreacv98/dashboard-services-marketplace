# Dashboard Services Marketplace
## Description
This is a dashboard which allows a user to register on the system (with Keycloak integration) and interact with the services offered by other third party providers (a.k.a. "service providers"). Through the dashboard the user can:
- subscribe to a service
- request Liqo peering with a service provider
- request the service provisioning through the Liqo peering
